              "200  i owe around to chase and am in a debt resolution program with xxxx xxxx xxxx i provided chase the number to xxxx xxxx xxxx and was told not to have any further contact with chase representatives as xxxx representatives would handle it as of friday xxxxxxxx i  have been receiving calls from xxxx xxxx formerly known as xxxx xxxx xxxx they are a credit collections company used by chase on friday i received calls on both xxxx and xxxx i received one call and today on xxxx i have received three calls one of these calls was a call to my office asking to speak to me however i was in a meeting the man who called was very aggressive to my boss who answered i checked with a lawyer and learned that repeated calls on the same day and calling my work are illegal practices calling my place of work puts my job at risk as stated before i have provided the number for xxxx xxxx xxxx whom they are supposed to be working with

              "203  jp morgan and chase reported loans   xxxx  xxxx and  xxxx respectively  as  cancelled debt to the irs on my behalf in xxxxxxxx they sent s to a nonexistent address one that has never been used or reported by me or my cosigner the address they used is a splicing of separate addresses in different cities in the same state this cancellation was done after chase claims they made multiple attempts to contact my cosigner for repayment an arguable fact as my cosigner has absolutely no knowledge or paperwork to that affect though chase has her correct address and phone number  i have confirmed this through phone calls with chase \\n\\nmy cosigner is a retired account and as such she keeps every scrap of paper concerning loans and financing she receives and she has no record of the loans chase reported cancellednor do i so i contacted chase to request copies of the original loan contracts as proof that the loans are in fact mine these loans do not show up on either of our credit reports so we are questioning where they came from \\n\\nmy first phone call to chase was on xxxxxxxx i spoke to a woman named xxxx in the irs notice department she was  unable to provide further information  because chase no longer directly deals with student loans i could not get a direct number into chase so i contacted our local chase bank branch and spoke to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information i was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could \\n\\nwhen i hadnt heard anything i reached back out to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through chase s complaint and compliance department \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i was contacted by xxxx  id  xxxx  with the complaint and compliance department she said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans when they completed their search she would be back in touch with what they found \\n\\non xxxxxxxx xxxx called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the chase recovery and loan specialist department who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation i was seeking \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted the loan specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the loan numbers amounts and cosigner i asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans  drop off as soon as they are cancelled  a statement that is absolutely false i requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue the contract was post marked xxxxxxxx and arrived xxxxxxxx however the contract she sent was not the correct loan contract it was not the correct dates amount or loan number\\n\\nrealizing that i wasnt getting anywhere my cosigner contacted chase on xxxxxxxx attempting to get the information i requested the man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts referred her to the irs for further questions \\n\\non xxxxxxxx my cosigner again contacted chase to directly request contract copies for these loans on this phone call she was told she was not a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted chase again and spoke to loan specialist   xxxx who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans she said the original loans were taken out between xxxx she said loans were charged off xxxxxxxx letters sent in xxxx and reported cancelled in xxxx this time she could not confirm the address the s were sent to she said she had no idea where the address came from  she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports  she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to  fix  the non reported loans  i declined  she said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the s for these loans to be sent to me in business days unfortunately the only documentation she sent were s with the wrong address i have still yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts\\n\\nit has been months numerous phones calls and misinformation and i can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility i once again called chase on xxxxxxxx and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans i was transferred to a voicemail left a very specific message with appropriate contact information and i have yet to receive a phone call back as of xxxxxxxx even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within business

              "228  to supervisor i wish to make a complaint regarding the case managment of xxxx xxxx i would like to bring to the attention that mr xxxx failed to properly communicate with me and my representative i received the following calls from mr xxxx    xxxx at xxxx xxxx he left voice mail \\nxxxx at xxxx xxxx we spoke briefly and i asked him to call back at noon \\nxxxx xxxx at xxxx xxxx he left voice mail \\nxxxx at xxxx xxxx i left voice message for a return call his voice message indicated a return call within hours \\nxxxx at xxxx xxxx i left another voice messsage for return call \\n\\ndue to not returning my calls and the importance of my issues i reached out to my representive from xxxx who began making calls to mr xxxx on my behalf i am sure she made notes on the date and time she left several messages there was even a little joke on when mr xxxx was going to return her call she said  watch he is going to call her when he is about to walk out the door  later that day i forgot what day it was be mr xxxx sure enough called at xxxx according to his outgoing voice message he gets off at xxxx having dealt with sneaky tactics by chase for years i could only shack my head \\n\\nat the time i needed to speak directly with him having worked in an environment where i need to stay on top of clients and files i know that a supervisor needs to be notified when there is a failure to meet expectations i expected a phone call to verbally answer questions i did not get that nor did my representative

              "265  i am submitting a complaint regarding the actions that chase performed on xxxxxxxx by selling the home i previously owned via foreclosure despite an active sales contract that was approved and agreed upon through xxxx tn bankruptcy court \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i entered into agreement with xxxx xxxx real estate agent for xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx tn to begin the process of a short sale of my home the initial proposed sales contract dated xxxxxxxx was submitted to chase for review and consideration on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase stating the amount submitted was too low to consider and to submit a new or updates sales contract \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase indicating that my home was scheduled for foreclosure on xxxxxxxx two days later xxxxxxxx a new contract was submitted with a new buyer and a new amount of xxxx chase approved the short sale with the proposed amount the sales agreement listed the closing date as xxxxxxxx this sale was approved by the tn xxxx   district bankruptcy court on xxxxxxxx the agreed short sale was stopped because  seller unable to provide good title  because the home was in bankruptcy a lien was placed on it to assure that any proceeds of the sale would be paid to jp morgan chase as part of the bankruptcy agreement the approval authorizing the sale specifically stated conditions that jp morgan chase bank and all liens would be paid in full as the closing \\n\\non xxxxxxxx chase sold the home as a foreclosure auction by a third party at the same approved amount of xxxx chase was fully aware that a short sale which had been approved by the bankruptcy court was to have been completed by xxxxxxxx once the sale had been completed all liens would have been released and the seller could have received a complete title free from any liens \\n\\nbecause chase did not fulfill the approval of the sale via bankruptcy and sold the home as a foreclosure i will now have a foreclosure listed on my credit and that should not be the case chase negligence in adhering to the approval of the sale has now placed my credit in a dismal state \\n\\nbecause chase neglected to fulfill the approved sale of the home that was agreed upon and in process of closing on xxxxxxxx a foreclosure was performed once the short sale had been completed the new homeowner would have received a title that was free from all liens

              "293  i ask chase auto finance please honor the written agreement and refund an amount of xxxx based on the excess mileage amount in section of our lease change their policies so that they specifically communicate the effective due date in writing so customers don’t feel threatened to pay any amount they claim as soon as possible before the account gets closed and sent to collections without prior noticeplease find the details of my claim belowonxxxxxxxx i returned a leased car for which i had a car loan with chase auto finance onxxxxxxxx i received a letter from the end of lease department at chase auto finance with my total lease liability including excess mileagethe excess mileage amount due was xxxx which assumed a charge of xxxx cents per excess mile however this does not match what was stipulated in my lease agreement with xxxx xxxx xxxx which stated in section that “you may be charged for excessive wear based on our standards for normal use and for mileage in excess of a xxxxxxxx miles per year at a rate of b xxxx  cents per mile” please find a copy of my lease agreement attachedthis came as a surprise to me because a few months before the end of my lease i spoke with xxxx xxxx from jxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the sales person i attended me in xxxxxxxx when i took lease of the car i explained to him that my lease stated an excess of xxxx  cents per mile instead of xxxx cents per mile and he said that someone probably made a mistakethe excess mileage amount stated in the lease agreement is xxxx  cents not xxxx cents therefore the amount owed for excess mileage should be xxxx i ask chase auto finance to please honor the written agreement and refund the difference of xxxxi have tried to remediate this issue with chase before reaching this point i called the end of lease department at xxxx xxxx several times and i spoke with different people the first time onxxxxxxxx i was asked to fax my lease agreement so they could compare it against what they had on their records i called again on xxxxxxxx and twice on xxxxxxxx in all instances i was told that the agreement stated xxxx cents per mile and that the amount owed would not be amended on xxxxxxxx i tried to escalate my complaint to a supervisor i spoke with someone with idxxxxxxxxxxxx who told me i would get a call back from another supervisor in hours i asked for a contact number in case i did not hear back and i got a phone number xxxx xxxx and a name xxxx but they refused to give me a last name i never received a call back or a voicemailduring one of these calls i also asked what the due date to pay the amount owed was because the letter i originally received from chase just said “please pay this amount upon receipt of this letter” i was told that they would close the account after between and days after being open and send it to collections i asked to get that in writing but they refused several timesi got in touch with xxxx xxxx chase private client and xxxx xxxxxxxx chase branch manager from the xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx ca office who helped escalate the issue with chase auto finance they first asked me to call xxxx xxxx extension xxxx and ask for xxxx who i talked to and got the same response as before then they opened a ticket with the chase branch complaint escalation team and i got in touch with xxxx xxxx xxxx   extension xxxx who reached out to chase auto finance they reviewed my case and they stood by their decision of charging me xxxx cents per milei then asked xxxx if she could ask chase auto finance to get clarity on the due date she called them and was told that they could close the account and send it to collections as soon as days after being opened and again refused to provide written proofgiven the circumstances i felt threatened to pay the total amount due to protect my credit score

stated to me and my wife that  jp morgan chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering loan terms and interest rate to me and my wife \\n\\nshe lied when she presented to me and my wife that jp morgan chase selection of the lowest fico score was due to chases guideline  s  policy \\n\\nwhen we asked for a copy of chases guidelines she and her manager mr xxxx lied when they stated that jp morgan chase guidelines are internal documents and are not given out \\n\\nwhen ms xxxx tried to cover ms xxxx lie xxxx xxxx instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because chase does meet their competitors pricing and interest rate however when we submitted a written quote from a competitor mr xxxx in support of ms xxxx stated in an email communication that chase does not meet competitors pricing and since we had not provided a good faith fee and did not submit all documentation  we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the xxxx fico score and pricing or cancel the process \\n\\nms xxxx email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors pricinginterest rate using a xxxx fico score as ms xxxx instructed us to do with the words where did you get this from never addressing that fact that the interest rate quoted was and we did what she asked of us\\n\\nms xxxx was asked not to load any of the cost into the loan she did it anyway and when asked several times to update the loan amount she did not complete that task until friday xxxx xxxx evening when she was on her way out the door for the week \\n\\nms xxxx lied when she sent me the initial myhomechase email to login andor create login credentials in order to begin the process ms xxxx failed to provide me with the loan application number when my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the hours account creation expired ms xxxx stated that she did not provide the loan application number because she wanted me to give her a call when i discovered that i could not move forward \\n\\nit was during my wife phone conference with executive director mr xxxx xxxx on friday xxxxxxxx at xxxx that he confirmed the lies that ms xxxx represented on behalf of chase it was disclosed that chase does uses the middle fico score not the lowest it was also disclosed that chase did not have any such guideline  s  policy of using the lowest fico score as previously represented to us by ms xxxx xxxx it was disclosed that ms xxxx did not years of experience as a home loan advisor with chase mr xxxx further confirmed that ms xxxx has worked for chase for several years as a teller along with assisting other loan advisors i believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that ms xxxx has worked on alone \\n\\nmr xxxx in good faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to chases xxxx location but my wife decided to give ms xxxx the benefitofthe doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process \\ni believe mr xxxx xxxx stated to my wife that he had a conversation with ms xxxx regarding the issues \\n\\nhowever it was a big mistake to leave ms xxxx in place it also appears that the conversation that mr xxxx had with ms xxxx did not work \\nthroughout friday xxxxxxxx late afternoon ms xxxx sent me several misleading emails informing me that my loan documents were ready for me to login to myhomechase to complete the loan application process and to paid the good faith fee \\n\\ni emailed her to alert her that the documents had not been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents she then sent me another email late friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents i waited for i believe hours and i emailed her back to share with her that i had not received the separate email later in the afternoonearly evening my wife placed a call to her her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nshortly after that the separate email arrived i login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the old documents i email ms xxxx back with both mr xxxx  mr xxxx on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting ms xxxx with hanging the revised documents neither mr xxxx nor mr xxxx responded \\n\\nhowever ms xxxx did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on monday and that the only thing she did was to change the loan amount \\nshe went on to let me know that mr xxxx nor mr xxxx could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nin conclusion as far as i am concerned all of the above behavior is a clear representation of unfair business practices and fraudulent business practices which my last email on friday xxxx xxxx that mr xxxx responded back to and forward to his executive office clearly reflects my disdained for being subjected to  ms xxxx and mr xxxx fraudulent and unlawful conduct   \n",

              "373  i found that in xxxxxxxx chase my mortgage company had not been reporting my mortgage payments after alerting chase on xxxxxxxx chase sent me a letter that stated they agree with me and they would begin reporting to the major credit reporting agencies listing them specifically including xxxx \\non xxxxxxxx i wrote to chase alerting them that my xxxx credit report in fact did not list them at all xxxx xxxx executive director with chase wrote back xxxxxxxx and essentially blamed xxxx stating  theres an internal credit agency policy thats preventing your account from showing up on your credit file  chase advised that i contact xxxx \\non xxxxxxxx i spoke indepth to several departments at xxxx and they do not have chase as a creditor that is reporting my mortgage payments \\ndespite me telling chase that i spoke with xxxx giving chase a copy of my credit report showing that they are not listed and telling chase that xxxx  suggested they call them chase has not called them or attempted to correct my report instead chase is deliberately not reporting and deliberately lying to me by continuing to claim that they are chase simply keeps telling me they are reporting

              "402  i applied for a chase credit card affiliated with united airlines i was sent an email at application that stated further review was needed after days i contacted chase to inquire about the status the automated response said it was still in review i then opted to talk to a representative the call was answered and i asked status and was told it was denied i asked why and they wouldnt give me a reason i stated i believed that there must be some type of mistake that they either had my income wrong or debt wrong because i know my credit score is in the upper s i only have one other credit card with a larger limit but paid in full monthly and a house payment i know my debt to income ratio is and i have been in the same line of work for over years i happen to be a xxxx  xxxx and know there is no business reason that i would be denied so there had to be an error somewhere in the application process i said i assumed they were double counting my mortgage as i had recently refinanced and they could easily be double counting the lady wouldnt respond in any way i asked to speak to a loan officer or supervisor to try and resolve any possible issue and was asked if i didnt mind being called back and i replied that was fine she said i would receive a call within the next minutes and verified my phone number i have never received a call back ive been a customer of chase in the past and all my accounts and all were handled as agreed ive never missed or been late on a payment in my life i understand if there was an error on my application but the fact they wouldnt wont and havent allowed me to address the issue even after repeated attempts is a major problem it is either a problem or they are discriminating

              "413  in regards to xxxx  chase card services  can someone tell me whats the point of having this company as travel insurance from my understanding the point of travel insurance is to protect a travel purchaseinvestment from an unforeseen issue well if thats the case please ditch this company and find someone more reliable who will step in and actually pay you back your lost investment when things get messy or out of hand between other vendors and third partiesthis is an absolute scam a disservice to the customers theyre supposedly serving and puts the insurance industry in a more negative light than it already is in \\n\\ni advised on xxxx  xxxx xxxx xxxx about a trip cancellation request in regards to a medical issue and proceeded as expected  i uploaded medical documents made notations of my fare and provided all necessary correspondence between the travel agent  flightsmojo  and the common carrier  sq  xxxx then suggested i reach out to both the airline and travel agent and request what documentation is needed both parties said differing statements and both can hardly speak a lick of english and why am i reaching out im literally doing your work for you this is your job not mine \\n\\nthe problem only got much worse when xxxx repeatedly asked for an updated medical document from my physician s office to which i complied and then they asked for an updated medical document with a fancy signature and a stamp  and another one with nicer handwriting to the point where they were just beating around the bush to hope the situation drops its clear to see they  dont want to comply with the situation because they would be losing money on the ticket sale hence the repeated use of asking for new medical documentation \\n\\nxxxx s clause of  did you attempt to reach out for refunds or credits  is an absolute joke because clearly i did and have provided the documents ad nauseum but the third party here is avoiding the situation to not lose their profit this travel insurer shouldve stepped in and solved the issue directly by providing a refund for the airfare based on the travel agent s reluctance to cooperate given the excessive requests when the claims examiner makes useless statements like   after all sir we are just a secondary travel insurance provider and theres nothing we can really do  is an insult equivalent to rubbing salt in the wound way to be more of the problem than the solution \\n\\n\\nif you have xxxx with your visa xxxx or other travel based credit card please stay away from using this insurer i was super optimistic about this perk with my chase sapphire reserve but  now have found it to be absolutely worthless ive heard the insurance on xxxx xxxx is better but ill have to see for myself this company is without a doubt useless and scammy and is in dire need a class action lawsuit against them

              "434  on i went into a chase branch to close a checking account and change the source account of my chase auto loan automatic payments to a nonchase account since i am attempting to close the chase checking account currently linked to my auto loan payments i was informed that i am unable to make this change in person and that i must fax in a form that can allegedly be found online additionally i was told i should wait to change this information until after my next scheduled payment had been processed \\n\\non i called chase customer service for assistance since attempts to access the online form resulted in errors during this call i was passed to different representatives each time being instructed to go to their website to download the same form that resulted in error messages finally the last person i spoke with was able to explain that my loan was associated with something called xxxx they informed me that as chase is no longer associated with xxxx and that due to this i am unable to simply update the account that i would like to pay my auto loan through and would need to apply for a new loan with chase in order to pay from a different account i was finally told that i would be sent the form to change the account for the automatic payments and i should receive the form in about business days \\n\\non i received a letter in the mail from chase stating  we have enclosed an automatic change agreement for you to complete  unfortunately there was no form enclosed i called their customer service again on at xxxx xxxx cst to speak to someone about this issue once again i was informed that there is nothing they can do to update my source of payment after being on the phone for minutes with this representative i was transferred to a manager who told me they would actually send the form this time \\n\\nplease note that nearly a month later as of i have yet to be able to cancel my checking account with chase furthermore as of i will be assessed a service fee for an account i have been trying to close for over a month \\n\\nforcing me to apply for a new loan and negatively impact my credit just to be able to pay my current loan from a different nonchase account feels extremely unfair and i feel as though chase is intentionally delaying my ability to change the source of my payments in order to get more fees from me

              "446  on i filed a complaint with cfpb against chase mortgage lender because they outright sold my note without providing me days of notice prior to this transaction \\n\\nthe only way i found out the true date of sale is from the buyer who accidentally included the true date of sale in a letter to me \\n\\nchase got upset that i filed this complaint and tried to call me when they are prohibited from direct calls to me as i am in a federally protected chapter xxxx chase is only allowed to notify my lawyer of any transaction that takes place they also need to notify the chapter xxxx trustee which they did not do \\n\\non after their illegal call to me they sent me a non certified letter explaining they received my complaint while simultaneously failing to communicate any of this matter to my law firm or the xxxx county court trustee \\n\\ntwo days after their letter ironically the new lender sent me a foreclosure notice claiming ive been late on my new payment when i have never missed a payment all of my payments are processed through the chapter xxxx trustee court filing system in xxxx county this is deceptive and total harassment during the holiday season it appears that chase waited to perform these sneaky actions \\n\\nas a result we are hiring a firm to perform a total xxxx report on the chase mortgage to discover whether or not they have sold bonds separating the bond from the note on this loan i have every intention of filing a respa suit and more against them for these actions

like to point out that i went into a chase branch and showed them chase documents that the scammer sent to me regarding the wire transfer and was told by the banker that the documents were indeed legitimate after trusting the banker i felt comfortable sending the funds believing this was a trustworthy transaction i tried contacting chase to see if they could reverse or refund the charges however they only pointed to the terms and conditions of xxxx and said it was nonrefundable they did not try to help at all in retrieving the money or finding a way to dispute the scam i was told that it only should be used with small amounts and to family friends etc xxxx nor chase bank makes this information easily accessible and in the end the only person that loses out is the customervictim

xxxx xxxx i didnt have any income at all while i was out i had just purchased my first home right before i got hurt so i had a new mortgage and utility bills for myself and two families i called chase as soon as i knew i wasnt going to be working they said over and over it was okay we could work it out when i got back to work then a month in they started putting me as delinquent i tried to pay but you cant get something from nothing all of my money was going to heat and electric and food i even wiped my retirement account just to keep the house afloat i contacted chase again and asked them to just hold on for two months until i was back at work they said okay thats fine to take care of your health then the next month they closed my accounts im drowning in it i cant believe after years of an excellent business relationship this multimillion dollar company couldnt give me a threemonth stay im back to work now one month behind on my mortgage and hundreds of dollars in fees later from chase but im chipping away at it and they just keep threatening my credit score and sending it to collections if i dont pay them an immediate sum thats more than ill make in a month i just need help i

              "531  in response to a complaint i filed xxxx xxxx from the chase executive office attempted to reach me by calling my wife s phone number on separate occasions my wife was not able to take the call because she was at work i returned each call and left messages asking ms xxxx to call me at my phone number  she had initially called me at the correct number several times  on the third call i made to ms xxxx i told her if she did not call me at the correct number i would file another complaint regarding this matter she has not called back but someone named xxxx from chase is now calling the incorrect number i have left a message for him with the correct number and am filing this complaint hoping it will compel chase to address this matter in good faith

of dubious candor as articulated in the plain language of california civ which articulate the following  civil codeciv division obligations   part enacted one who willfully deceives  another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers \\na deceit within the meaning of the last section is either  the suggestion as a fact of that which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true  the assertion as a fact of that which is not true by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true  the suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact  or a promise made without any intention of performing it\\n\\n enacted back and forth bantering  emails dispersed from myself to ms xxxx xxxx and my wife to ms xxxx xxxx   chapter added by stats ch as used in this part in connection with housing accommodations unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context   c   discrimination  includes provision  of inferior terms conditions privileges facilities or

borrower\\n\\nthe sole and exclusive disclaimer made by the agents of chase which appears to countervails us c a   a  is the following statement  ms xxxx as an agent for jp morgan chase lied when she stated to me and my wife that  jp morgan chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering loan terms and interest rate to me and my wife \\n\\nshe lied when she presented to me and my wife that jp morgan chase selection of the lowest fico score was due to chases guideline  s  policy \\n\\nwhen we asked for a copy of chases guidelines she and her manager mr xxxx lied when they stated that jp morgan chase guidelines are internal documents and are not given out \\n\\nwhen ms xxxx tried to cover ms xxxx lie xxxx xxxx instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because chase does meet their competitors pricing and interest rate however when we submitted a written quote from a competitor mr xxxx in support of ms xxxx stated in an email communication that chase does not meet competitors pricing and since we had not provided a good faith fee and did not submit all documentation  we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the xxxx fico score and pricing or cancel the process \\n\\nms xxxx email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors pricinginterest rate using a xxxx fico score as ms xxxx instructed us to do with the words where did you get this from never addressing that fact that the interest rate quoted was and we did what she asked of us\\n\\nms xxxx was asked not to load any of the cost into the loan she did it anyway and when asked several times to update the loan amount she did not complete that task until friday xxxx xxxx evening when she was on her way out the door for the week \\n\\nms xxxx lied when she sent me the initial myhomechase email to login andor create login credentials in order to begin the process ms xxxx failed to provide me with the loan application number when my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the hours account creation expired ms xxxx stated that she did not provide the loan application number because she wanted me to give her a call when i discovered that i could not move forward \\n\\nit was during my wife phone conference with executive director mr xxxx xxxx on friday xxxxxxxx at xxxx that he confirmed the lies that ms xxxx represented on behalf of chase it was disclosed that chase does uses the middle fico score not the lowest it was also disclosed that chase did not have any such guideline  s  policy of using the lowest fico score as previously represented to us by ms xxxx xxxx it was disclosed that ms xxxx did not years of experience as a home loan advisor with chase mr xxxx further confirmed that ms xxxx has worked for chase for several years as a teller along with assisting other loan advisors i believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that ms xxxx has worked on alone \\n\\nmr xxxx in good faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to chases xxxx location but my wife decided to give ms xxxx the benefitofthe doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process \\ni believe mr xxxx xxxx stated to my wife that he had a conversation with ms xxxx regarding the issues \\n\\nhowever it was a big mistake to leave ms xxxx in place it also appears that the conversation that mr xxxx had with ms xxxx did not work \\nthroughout friday xxxxxxxx late afternoon ms xxxx sent me several misleading emails informing me that my loan documents were ready for me to login to myhomechase to complete the loan application process and to paid the good faith fee \\n\\ni emailed her to alert her that the documents had not been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents she then sent me another email late friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents i waited for i believe hours and i emailed her back to share with her that i had not received the separate email later in the afternoonearly evening my wife placed a call to her her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nshortly after that the separate email arrived i login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the old documents i email ms xxxx back with both mr xxxx  mr xxxx on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting ms xxxx with hanging the revised documents neither mr xxxx nor mr xxxx responded \\n\\nhowever ms xxxx did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on monday and that the only thing she did was to change the loan amount \\nshe went on to let me know that mr xxxx nor mr xxxx could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a nice weekend \\n\\nin conclusion as far as i am concerned all of the above behavior is a clear representation of unfair business practices and fraudulent business practices which my last email on friday xxxx xxxx that mr xxxx responded back to and forward to his executive office clearly reflects my disdained for being subjected to  ms xxxx and mr xxxx fraudulent and unlawful conduct</td>\n",

              "43   chase sent me an email today with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase

              "17   with out notice jp morgan chase restricted my account by my debit card tuesday on thursday i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they

              "65   i opened the chasexxxx xxxx rewards credit card at the time i was verbally told that the offer was xxxx rapid reward points and a companion pass after spending  xxxx in the first three months i followed a link provided to open the credit card now they are saying that the offer was over at the time and they have given me a much less valuable signup promotion that doesnt include the companion pass the companion pass was the entire reason we signedup and the reason the card was promoted to me they have informed me that the offer was from jan and that my cc shows approval on the xxxx xxxx the supervisor i spoke to said that they specifically dont send out offer details to confirm your offer when you sign up  thus denying me evidence  but also that they cant fix it without this evidence i feel that their offer and subsequent actions are fraudulent and constitute deceptive practices when i spoke to xxxx they acknowledged that it doesnt seem right but stated that chase is the one who has to authorize the deals so the error was definitely on their end

              "59   i currently have over xxxx chase ultimate rewards points which are worth at least around months ago  when i tried to access my chase ultimate rewards account  or even activate the bonus on chase freedom  i would get shown this page that says  we are unable to complete your request at this time   image attached as well   xxxx  xxxx at first i thought it was just a temporary error  which isnt uncommon for chase  but after weeks this was still happening so i called customer support they opened a ticket got escalated to their tech team but when i would call back to find out what happened they told me that the case had been closed this happened times and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information \\n\\ngoing from ultimaterewardscom and chasecom have the  same result \\n\\nim not able to use these points by phone either because the operators for the travel center are not able to access my accountpoints neither \\n\\nive tried every browser both xxxx and xxxx computers and the xxxx chase phone application they all send me to the page that says  we are unable to complete your request at this time  on xxxxxxxx i looked up some people that work in ultimate rewards on xxxx and cold called a vp of customer relations he acted like he was helpful at first and we exchanged some emails he eventually said i can buy a flighthotel using chase sapphire and if i give him the details he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase \\n\\nlong story short he wasnt able to fix anything \\n\\ni can see that im still collecting points but i havent been able to access it \\n\\ni travel a lot and its become a huge inconvenience that im not able to access these points which i intended to use for travel i need to get this issue resolved asap

my chase savings account and the other user on my account i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user customer rep told me they would call me back in minutes to keep the line open i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process called the catering company and card was declined i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for hours called caterer  card declined use a mastercard  which processed went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of it was declined i was told by chase i was not over limit still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the transaction never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before  today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear  it never did

              "64   chase is marketing credit cards to those of us with good credit like its going out of style be careful  the marketing is not clear if you already have a swa chase personal card do not apply for the new one online this has sent me through a xxxx triangle wasting my time and therefore money \\n\\nit appears in the middle of chase expanded their undisclosed rule to include all cobranded cards not just swa yet the marketing machine continues to ignore this policy and the agents on the phone are not well trained i am contacting the credit bureau bc two of the cards opened are not mine  that is the silver lining here \\n\\nhowever the issue with incessant marketing of their branded cards to customers plus this confusing rule and lack of agent phone training is false advertising the information is still relatively opaque as chase never comments on the rule but multiple reader and community data points suggest denials due to for cards previously exempt \\n\\ncfpb staff please help educate consumers and hold the big banks accountable for deceptive trade practices i do not believe this is intentional on chase s part but the second to last agent did encourage me to file a complaint here so be it \\n\\nthank you \\n\\nxxxx

              "82   i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx

              "58   i made a purchase of on xxxxxxxx i made payments of on xxxxxxxx and on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase  was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx

              "287  i have a chase sapphire reserved card and the payment is due the first of the month to pay the bill i can go through the chase credit card website and it automatically draws the payment from my bank account the payment normally takes several hours to be completed although they do state that it can take up to two business days i normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month \\n\\ni have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instances the credit card is saying payments have been late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instances i know i made the payments on time but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees when i found out i called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged more recently for this past xxxx it occurred again and then for xxxx i went online and made the payment but when i got my statement for xxxx recently its saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both xxxx and xxxx i am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it but its now seeming to be a pattern and i have heard from others who have this credit card  and other credit cards  that they experience this as well i dont know if its just errors in these companies  systems or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers i am lucky in that i am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them but i worry that many consumers wont notice or wont know how to challenge them and so just pay them i am wondering if others have complained about this to cfpb and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect consumers across the country

transferred the files and told xxxx that chase said i was bankrupt and to terminate the processes xxxx did and did not pay chase any longer i have received no communication from anyone on this i was going to open a checking account at chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid i called and they said that xxxx will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy which i am not in since the mortgage holder would know after much pain i was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to xxxx so they can restart my payments however i had to make a complete payment pay late fees and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history \\n\\nxxxx was negligent with the files transfer and xxxx was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered \\n\\nwhat can be done i have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me no one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances i thought that i am entitled to all records about myself \\n\\ni am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run xxxx must have been really evil and xxxx doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person xxxx did not let me know they were changing services \\n\\ni can provide only the mortgage verification from chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed evidently xxxx did not use a human review process to read only accept checked fields of bad records

              "21   on xxxx i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team

              "45   i made a purchase with xxxx xxxx xxxx on in the amount of i was charged twice for this transaction i placed a disputes case with chase bank on when i noticed the charge on my account i called back on sunday about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided i used my debt card on monday then tried to use it again but it would not work i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within days i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday xxxxxxxx and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily \\n\\nonce again i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past

              "130  i purchased tickets  using my xxxx xxxx xxxx chase credit card  for my family of four and my two parents to go overseas from the us to xxxx for the first time last fall i purchased through a discount airline  xxxx  as it would not have been financially possible with another carrier our tickets were round trip not purchased as individual one way fares four tickets were purchased for my family on xxxxxxxx  and my parents tickets were purchased xxxxxxxx all six of us flew from the us xxxxxxxx my family of four were set to return xxxxxxxx with my parents set to return xxxxxxxx \\n\\nas xxxx airlines began experiencing financial difficulties they started changing and cancelling flights my return was cancelled because my flight from xxxx to xxxx wasnt being flown i was told by xxxx if i could get to xxxx on another airline i could catch a flight from xxxx back to the us with xxxx needing to get back to work as a teacher i booked flights from xxxx to xxxx at my own expense two days later xxxx failed altogether my new tickets to xxxx were now worthless as xxxx could no longer able to get me back to the us and no other carriers had flights to my destination \\n\\nbecause of this i was forced to buy new tickets from xxxx to the us on united airlines for all passengers obviously this caused some serious stress throughout our trip and also some serious financial strain that was unexpected the return flight i purchased were as much as the round trip tickets i had originally purchased on wow so my airfare essentially doubled \\n\\nupon contacting chase when i got home i was told that i would only partially be refunded because i was provided partial service the customer service representative and supervisor  both of which were friendly  equated it to buying a pair of pants and a shirt if the pants were not acceptable i still have to pay for the shirt my contention is a little different i purchased round trip tickets all part of the same trip the service i purchased was to get me to my destination and get me back to my origin all as one transaction \\n\\ni was not left in a better position by being flown across the world and left with not so much as an email from xxxx that they were closing i incurred additional flight lodging food etc my questions for the representatives were simple but with no adequate responses \\n\\nif i buy a flight with a connection if i am flown to the connecting city but not flown to my destination is this considered a service should i have to pay for part of a flight \\nif i pay someone to put on a new roof and they tear it off but dont put new shingles back on do i have to pay for partial service \\n\\nin both of these cases just like my case we were not left in a better position we were most definitely left in a much worse position if xxxx was still in business i would be asking them for a complete refund and if that did not work i would be suing them for damages according to xxxx xxxx xxxx which would have applied if they were still in business i would have been entitled to xxxx euros per flight for the original cancellation of my return as well as the cancellation of the rescheduled flight they would also be liable for lodging new flights booked food etc in total this would add up to literally  xxxx \\n\\nyet i am being told by chase that xxxx in some way provided me something for which i should be grateful enough to pay of the original in actuality it seems much more likely that chase is not willing to take on this liability since xxxx is not here anymore to refund me the money however this is why i use my credit card to make these purchases consumer protection \\n\\ni have worked through multiple levels of employees but non have been empowered to make an actual decision beyond  sorry company policy

              "129  this complaint is a follow up regarding a complaint  xxxx filed on cfpb \\n\\nthe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below \\n\\nmy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination i immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notificationi filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund \\nchase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation when i asked i was told that i benefited from the transactions clearly i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination later the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop proof that the flights were booked under my name however the date of births used to book the flights were not mine clearly i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to \\nthe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes \\ni am over that but this complaint i am filing is not about the original claimplease read below about this complaint \\n\\nplease read this carefully \\n\\nafter this incident i contacted xxxx and inquired about the flight they told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund chase has not contacted xxxx once to resolve this issue xxxx has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account however chase hasnt issued me a refund whenever i contact chase they give me same old response the case has been closed i am not opening the same claim its a new complaint xxxx has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase xxxx s customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and detailsthis is chase banks job connect with them and find out whats going on instead chase is asking me to contact xxxx and prove that the refund has been issued xxxx is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issuesnow i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted \\ni am attaching the documents that xxxx has provided me chase has asked me to provide these documents its chase s job but i am doing this ob their behalf \\n\\nxxxx is clearly stating that the bank has the funds they have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account \\n\\nplease issue me a refund i have done everything i could have please do not close my complaint without issuing me a refund that xxxx has issued a long time ago \\nenough is enough

              "88   i preordered an item on xxxxxxxx and paid with a chase credit card the merchant xxxx xxxx gave an estimated product shipment date of  xxxxxxxx  after waiting for this item for a significant amount of time i decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped on xxxxxxxx i requested a refund from the merchant xxxx xxxx on xxxxxxxx the merchant stated that my order was cancelled and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days the original method of payment was a chase credit card that i had since closed on xxxxxxxx i sent a secure message to chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open chase cards i also followed up with a phone call that same week and the representative i spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase indicating that my  disputed charge  would remain on my account and  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  i followed up with a phone call to chase describing that this was a refund not a dispute the representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts i explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds they informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund i am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account on xxxxxxxx i sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails i received from the merchant about the refund  see attachment   on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase with similar language about  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  and  we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research   see attachment  on xxxxxxxx i followed up with the merchant xxxx xxxx requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds on xxxxxxxx the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded  see attachment  this was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant

refund thru xxxx xxxx i was told by xxxx xxxx that i needed to request the refund thru xxxx which i did i requested the refund and was told by xxxx that since i didnt purchase the ticket directly thru them but it was done thru a party i needed to go thru xxxx xxxx i went back to them and was told that they will not refund me \\ni then started a dispute with my credit card chase visa for the charges

              "101  i purchase is an airline ticket on xxxxxxxx and it was xxxx dollar but the i realize it was the wrong airport so i called right away to cancel the ticket and since it was before hours so i could cancel it and get a refund which is what supposed to post in my account in days and on xxxxxxxx i got the money back so i purchase another airline ticket with the same money that i got back but it was xxxx dollar and the money was taking out of my available balance on xxxxxxxx but it was saying pending on the statement but it was out of my available balance already on xxxxxxxx the xxxx dollar was taking again out of my account but showing in my account as it was only one charge  and i am not even able to see the first airline ticket or the refund on my statement because they said it was dropped charge like it was never happened but it did happenedthats not the first time this happened it did happened before but i usually get the money back after the weekend on monday but this time no it did got back  i tried calling them and they explaining but they only say one thing i dont see it on the statement so why i cant see my purchase for the first airline ticket that it was refunded this is my money and i am supposed to see all the charges i made and the refund on my account i am missing xxxx dollar from my account which is got disappeared from my bank account and i need to get this money back i dont know what to do

representatives as xxxx representatives would handle it as of friday xxxxxxxx i  have been receiving calls from xxxx xxxx formerly known as xxxx xxxx xxxx they are a credit collections company used by chase on friday i received calls on both xxxx and xxxx i received one call and today on xxxx i have received three calls one of these calls was a call to my office asking to speak to me however i was in a meeting the man who called was very aggressive to my boss who answered i checked with a lawyer and learned that repeated calls on the same day and calling my work are illegal practices calling my

took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information i was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could \\n\\nwhen i hadnt heard anything i reached back out to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through chase s complaint and compliance department \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i was contacted by xxxx  id  xxxx  with the complaint and compliance department she said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans when they completed their search she would be back in touch with what they found \\n\\non xxxxxxxx xxxx called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the chase recovery and loan specialist department who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation i was seeking \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted the loan specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the loan numbers amounts and cosigner i asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans  drop off as soon as they are cancelled  a statement that is absolutely false i requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue the contract was post marked xxxxxxxx and arrived xxxxxxxx however the contract she sent was not the correct loan contract it was not the correct dates amount or loan number\\n\\nrealizing that i wasnt getting anywhere my cosigner contacted chase on xxxxxxxx attempting to get the information i requested the man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts referred her to the irs for further questions \\n\\non xxxxxxxx my cosigner again contacted chase to directly request contract copies for these loans on this phone call she was told she was not a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted chase again and spoke to loan specialist   xxxx who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans she said the original loans were taken out between xxxx she said loans were charged off xxxxxxxx letters sent in xxxx and reported cancelled in xxxx this time she could not confirm the address the s were sent to she said she had no idea where the address came from  she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports  she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to  fix  the non reported loans  i declined  she said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the s for these loans to be sent to me in business days unfortunately the only documentation she sent were s with the wrong address i have still yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts\\n\\nit has been months numerous phones calls and misinformation and i can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility i once again called chase on xxxxxxxx and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans i was transferred to a voicemail left a very specific message with appropriate contact information and i have yet to receive a phone call back as of xxxxxxxx even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within business

payment in full and notation that i would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which i have received this reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end \\n\\nall subsequent payments have been made on time and as of xxxxxxxx the account has a balance due to charges made after payment in full

by chase for xxxx i filed a dispute and in xxxx received an email from xxxx  stating the dispute had been resolved upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed \\n\\ni contacted chase xxxx visa explained the negative reporting the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges they stated that the  credit bureau unit  was not currently open and requested i call back the next day and request to speak

me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to xxxx customer service \\n\\nin speaking with xxxx in customer service i believed that i was still speaking to the credit bureau department i recalled all events she confirmed the notation in the account additionally i advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on xxxxxxxx my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all chase accounts i was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account i received a screen that stated that i needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbersemail that were prepopulated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information i had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once i was able to gain access into the account i confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the default contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information \\n\\ni explained to her that when i tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account she assisted

negative reporting at this point she advised me that i had been transferred out of the credit bureau department and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to days to provide a call back \\n\\nshe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named xxxx explained the situation and xxxx told her that there  was nothing that

              "58   i made a purchase of on xxxxxxxx i made payments of on xxxxxxxx and on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of in xxxx the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase  was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx

              "82   i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app \\n\\nadditionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats xxxx

still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of xxxx her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd she told me that while they were  investigating  these open claims money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it finally on xxxxxxxx i received a voicemail from xxxx to call her as soon as possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that xxxx told me they closed their  investigation  of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their  investigation  xxxx became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was a lose lose situation

              "213  my mortgage is with chase my payments were being made by xxxx xxxx xxxx paying early each month xxxx was the provider of xxxx to chase evidently xxxx was sold to xxxx on xxxx transferred the files and told xxxx that chase said i was bankrupt and to terminate the processes xxxx did and did not pay chase any longer i have received no communication from anyone on this i was going to open a checking account at chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid i called and they said that xxxx will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy which i am not in since the mortgage holder would know after much pain i was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to xxxx so they can restart my payments however i had to make a complete payment pay late fees and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history \\n\\nxxxx was negligent with the files transfer and xxxx was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered \\n\\nwhat can be done i have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me no one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances i thought that i am entitled to all records about myself \\n\\ni am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run xxxx must have been really evil and xxxx doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person xxxx did not let me know they were changing services \\n\\ni can provide only the mortgage verification from chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed evidently xxxx did not use a human review process to read only accept checked fields of bad records

payment from my bank account the payment normally takes several hours to be completed although they do state that it can take up to two business days i normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month \\n\\ni have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instances the credit card is saying payments have been late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instances i know i made the payments on time but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees when i found out i called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged more recently for this past xxxx it occurred again and then for xxxx i went online and made the payment but when i got my statement for xxxx recently its saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both xxxx and xxxx i am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it but its now seeming to be a pattern and i have heard from others who have this credit card  and other credit cards  that they experience this as well i dont know if its just errors in these companies  systems or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers i am lucky in that i am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them but i worry that many consumers wont notice or wont know how to challenge them and so just pay them i am wondering if others have complained about this to cfpb and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect consumers across the country

              "317  ive been actively trying to resolve this concern with chase bank for the longest time since i was reported late days twice on my credit report due to no fault of my own \\n\\ni have spoke and confirmed this with a chase representative who agreed with me the system chase uses is false and leads to misinformation regarding accounts \\n\\nthe chase system does not show correct account activity when payments are made to their auto loan accounts until the entire balance is processed on its own \\n\\nsince the beginning of the lease ive had nothing but trouble trying to have my payments made and processed through chase without being charged some late fee when my payments are made on time \\n\\nback in xxxx i noticed the payments i had been sending to chase for my car were not being reflected on the balance my car payment due is each month if i submit a payment for that payment does not get applied to the balance whatsoever it will still reflect an amount of instead of thats is owed which is misleading and completely not fair \\n\\nit leads me to not know exactly how much is due after processing payments because even under recent activity it does not show the past payments ive made on the account only payments ive made months prior show up and not recent made payments \\n\\nits not fair chase does not apply the amounts ive paid to my car to help show the right balance due on my car this purposely misleads customers like me and we end up being penalized for not paying when weve processed multiple payments to our loan \\n\\ni should have not been reported late days for a past due balance of when i had made those payments and if chase updated the balances correctly customers such as myself would not have been reported late \\n\\nim kindly asking for chase to review and kindly update my credit report to reflect good standing due to bank errors that dont seem to get resolved

              "399  my wife and i have had a traditional xxxx yr mortgage with chase  account xxxx  since xxxx we were never delinquent on a payment each month chase sends me a monthly statement with a coupon for the next payment in xxxxxxxx i never recieved their statement or coupon and i did not send in my xxxx mortgage payment i recieved the statement  coupon for xxxx and xxxx was paid on time the first week of xxxx i was contacted by chase telling me our mortgage was delinquent i looked into it and agreed that i missed xxxx s payment and made payments in the next week to catch up now we are trying to apply for a line of credit but were denied as chase reported we were delinquent x payments i say we were delinquent for payment as when i was notified that our xxxx payment was never made i paid it plus our regular xxxx payment in the next few days \\nnow due to this error we have been denied a line of credit we need for expenses for an upcoming child s wedding not to mention the negative impact this has had on our credit score

              "420  i have been attempting for months to get chase bank to correct a negative report  plus days late  on my credit report they have refused to cooperate claiming the report is accurate  i filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies to no avail  i even retained an attorney  chase ignored her letters the payment in question was only two weeks late and the reason it was late is due to the fact that my automatic payments needed to be reauthorized and i was not informed of this fact once i realized the payment was late i immediately phoned chase to make the payment and reauthorized the automatic payments in short i have acted in good faith  and chase has refused to do the same \\n\\nthe document attached shows the payment going out on the payment was due on the xxxx

              "432  i purchased xxxx xxxx xxxx tickets through chase ultimate rewards portal on xxxx but i was not provided the tickets even after making full payment using my chase reward points the tickets were for visit to xxxx on xxxx i have called chase multiple times on xxxx and they are unable to provide a voucher even after receiving full payment this is complete deficiency in service further their call center employees put me on hold for several hours combined causing me mental agony and lost holiday time i didnt want to spend my holidays on calls with chase customer care the employees were not helpful and made false assurances on recorded conversations which were not fulfilled chase will be liable for all losses money time and otherwise incurred by me and my family due to such deficiency in service further the call center employees wanted to put me on a minute hold and refused to arrange a call back making me a virtual employee of chase without adequate consideration

              "527  i purchased my home through chase mortgage in as a first time homebuyer on an escrow payment of was applied directly to the escrow account going forward the original agreement signed in good faith indicated of the monthly payment would go towards the escrow account to cover insurance and property taxes i set up an auto pay for so additional principal would also be applied these amounts were paid and applied appropriately until the payment on where the escrow payment applied was dropped to down from the to continue paying the insurance but not the property taxes without my knowledge or consent i was confused and unsure as to why this happened but being a firsttime homebuyer assumed that because the previous home owner had a homestead exemption that granted him complete exemption from property taxes the taxes may have been reassessed and with already almost in the escrow account the monthly amount withdrawn could now be reduced believing the bank would apply funds as necessary i did not change my automatic payment  i continued the autopay that was set up to pay the monthly mortgage amount dictated by the bank plus the additional principal \\n\\nrecently i noticed a message on my online chase mortgage account that indicating my monthly payment would be changed once again but this time from to it appears that because the bank failed to continue applying escrow towards the property taxes they are now unfairly demanding that i double up on tax payments this year to clear last year s property taxes and put money into escrow for this year s property taxes of the payment it appears they are applying towards  escrow shortage   short due to the bank s error   and towards property taxes as you can imagine nearly doubling the monthly payment on a mortgage would no doubt create a severe financial hardship on a single mother i feel the bank was misleading and deceptive in their erroneous practice of changing the monthly payment without my consent and then expecting me to pay twice the amount in property to make up for their mistake

access into the account i confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the default contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information \\n\\ni explained to her that when i tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account she assisted with updating on her end had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information \\n\\ngiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup i asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting at this point she advised me that i had been transferred out of the credit bureau department and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to days to provide a call back \\n\\nshe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named xxxx explained the situation and xxxx told her that there  was nothing that he could do to assist  \\n\\ni have never been late with a payment across all accounts i have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with jp morgan chasexxxx as a result of chasexxxx xxxx it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment  provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that i will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from  outstanding  to  good  and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered \\n\\ni am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to assist with restoring my credit due to bankingit error on the part of the credit card issuer by sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from chase and have to deal with the same challenges i have faced</td>\n",
